Apache Spark is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.
Spark offers over 80 high-level operators that make it easy to build parallel apps.
You can use it interactively from the Scala, Python, R, and SQL shells.
Spark powers a stack of libraries including SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX, and Spark Streaming.
You can combine these libraries seamlessly in the same application.
